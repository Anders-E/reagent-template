## WORK IN PROGRESS!

A Leiningen template for projects using Reagent.

A Leiningen template for a Clojure/ClojureScript app based on Reagent,
with dynamic reloading of Clojure, ClojureScript, and CSS and a browser-connected REPL.

The template uses [lein-ring](https://github.com/weavejester/lein-ring) to provide
support of standalone runnable `jar` or `war` for container deployment.
In addition, the template provides the artifacts necessary for Heroku deployment.

## Usage

```
lein new reagent <name>
```
